# Exercise 3 - Git & Github

## Branches
**All group members** should be sure to have an updated version of your project.
**Each group member** should create a new branch, and then ```` add, commit, push ````.    

Your github shared repository now should consist of a ```` master ```` branch and a branch for each of the groups members.    

**Each group member** should add a new file to the project and put in some code. A new feature in the project.    
then ```` add, commit, push ````.    

**Group member 2** should merge his branch into the master branch.    
**All group members** should ````pull```` the master branch.


**Group member 3** should merge his branch into the master branch.    
**All group members** should ````pull```` the master branch.     

**Group member 1** should merge his branch into the master branch.    
**All group members** should ````pull```` the master branch.    


**Group member 4** should merge his branch into the master branch.    
**All group members** should ````pull```` the master branch.

Try to do the whole thing again, but without the _All group members should ````pull```` the master branch._    


## Branches with merge conflicts.
**All group members** should be sure to have an updated version of your project.
**Each group member** should create a new branch, and then ```` add, commit, push ````.     

**All group members** should create a method called ````drive()```` with a void return type. The methods body should be left empty. 
**Each group member** should  ```` add, commit, push ````.     

**Group member 1** should merge his branch into the master branch.
**All group members** should ````pull```` the master branch.    

**Group member 2** should merge his branch into the master branch.    
Fix the merge conflict, and ```` add, commit, push ````.    

**Group member 3** should merge his branch into the master branch.    
Fix the merge conflict, and ```` add, commit, push ````.    

**Group member 4** should merge his branch into the master branch.    
Fix the merge conflict, and ```` add, commit, push ````.
